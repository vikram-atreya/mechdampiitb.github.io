#### Instructor
Prof. Anil M. Kulkarni

#### Section
S1 (Entire 2nd-year Mechanical Batch)

#### Semester
Autumn

#### Course Difficulty
Moderate

#### Time Commitment Required
The initial part is fairly easy similar to the Jee stuff. After quiz 1 things become a little involved. The classes are more based on the general theory and the questions require solving skills which are taught only in the tutorials. Being thorough with the tutorial and at least solving them once after the discussion would suffice, although ut may vary from person to person. It is very important to be attentive during the tutorials and ask any doubt that crops up. For the theoretical part pay attention in class and going through the slides once a week for half an hour would help. 

#### Grading
Moderate

#### Attendence Policy
Compulsory Attendance

#### Pre-requisites
None. It is a very basic level Course

#### Evaluation Scheme and Weightages
Quizzes(best 2 out of 3) : 20%
Mid Sem: 30%
End Sem: 50%

#### Topics Covered in the Course
1. Transient and steady-state analysis of simple circuits. Basic physical laws, circuit elements and simple circuits. KVL, KCL, and a few important circuit theorems. Transients in R-L, R-C, R-L-C. Sinusoidal Steady State, Real/Reactive Power
2. Electrical apparatus and systems. Transformers, Electrical machines. Power Electronics and Power Systems
3. Analog devices and circuits, Functional characteristics of Diode, BJT, OP-AMP, etc. Analog circuit examples: rectifiers, amplifiers, oscillators etc. 
4. Digital Circuits, AND/OR gates, Flip Flops, DAC/ADC etc

#### Quality of Lectures
The instructor explains concepts well and clears all the doubts but do not expect him to deviate a lot into fancier side-topics. He teaches with quite a good pace. Most of the material is present in slides but if he is writing something on the board do copy it because that may not be present in the slides. Theory, in general, is not very difficult to comprehend but it all boils down to the ability to solve. Therefore, paying attention to the problem-solving and clearing out doubts in tutorials would be beneficial. 

#### Assignments and Projects for this Course
No assignments or Project work but the tutorial sheets had to be submitted.

#### Exams
Quizzes were easy if tutorials were solved sincerely. And, the difficulty level was consequently upped in the mid-semester and the quizzes after mid sem though the end sem being fairly easy. Solving the tutorials is enough for the initial quiz and midterm. The questions both in the mid-semester and the end semester exam would not be exceptionally different from what you’ve already encountered but there will be small modifications that need to be understood. It is very important that you fully understand the methodology to solve the circuits and the equations. The end sem covers some portion in which the theory and the values given in the slides need to be remembered.
